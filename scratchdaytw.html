<h3>Scratch Day TW 2019</h3>
<strong>May 18, 2019</strong><br/>The first ever Scratch Day Taiwan I organized! This was my first time teaching for a live audience and I was extremely nervous to deliver the workshop back then! I can't recall too many details, all I remember was how surprised I felt when my friends were so quick to say yes when I asked them to come help out as volunteers. This year taught me that people are generally willing to help out out of curiosity. Sometimes all it takes is a warm and enthusiastic invitation!</div></section>

<strong> July 18, 2020</strong><br/>I still think this is one of our most successful Scratch Day events to date! We had a great venue and such a wonderful turn out! This was also the year I published my <a href="https://enochkang.works/secretsofscratch.html" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> so that might be skweing my rose tinted view a certain way. I think the most memorable thing this year was how well the simple yet modular maze game workshop lesson plan I devised worked. I could see that kids of all experience ranges could find something engaging to latch on to and ultimately a simple engaging game was much more effective than some of the more theoretical or experimental workshops I've tried delivering in the following years.

<strong> July 8, 2023</strong> <br/>This was the first year I started experimenting with more experimental workshop content for the event. ChatGPT had gotten really popular around that time and I wanted to try something involving the new tech. The workshop was titled "Little AI Director" and we gave the kids a  fill in the blanks activity which they later put into AI as a prompt for a story. As all first experiments go, this one left me with much improvement to be desired. However, I did see first hand how including marketable ideas dramatically increases interest in our little event. This is something I am still learning to balance: catering to parents in the marketing, catering to children in the actual classroom.</div></section>

<strong> July 5, 2025</strong> <br/>This year we were once again working with Dayuan International Senior High school. We are working on involving the high school volunteers more and more each year. The hope is with more involvement from the volunteers we will be able to improve our capacity and reach larger groups more effectively! This year also got me thinking about the longer term plan for Scratch Day Taiwan as a whole. Since this is something I've committed to organizing each year, I think it would be great if there could be some continuous progression that can accumulate year on year... Maybe it will be in the form of developing a reusable modular lesson plan that is both engaging, practical, and fun!

I can't recall too many details, all I remember was how surprised I felt when my friends were so quick to say yes when I asked them to come help out as volunteers. This year taught me that people are generally willing to help out out of curiosity. Sometimes all it takes is a warm and enthusiastic invitation!",

This was also the year I published my [book](https://enochkang.works/secretsofscratch.html) so that might be skweing my rose tinted view a certain way. I think the most memorable thing this year was how well the simple yet modular maze game workshop lesson plan I devised worked. I could see that kids of all experience ranges could find something engaging to latch on to and ultimately a simple engaging game was much more effective than some of the more theoretical or experimental workshops I've tried delivering in the following years.\n",

ChatGPT had gotten really popular around that time and I wanted to try something involving the new tech. The workshop was titled \"Little AI Director\" and we gave the kids a  fill in the blanks activity which they later put into AI as a prompt for a story. As all first experiments go, this one left me with much improvement to be desired. However, I did see first hand how including marketable ideas dramatically increases interest in our little event. This is something I am still learning to balance: catering to parents in the marketing, catering to children in the actual classroom.",

The hope is with more involvement from the volunteers we will be able to improve our capacity and reach larger groups more effectively! This year also got me thinking about the longer term plan for Scratch Day Taiwan as a whole. Since this is something I've committed to organizing each year, I think it would be great if there could be some continuous progression that can accumulate year on year... Maybe it will be in the form of developing a reusable modular lesson plan that is both engaging, practical, and fun! \n",
