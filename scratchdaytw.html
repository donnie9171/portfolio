<h3>Workshops</h3>
We usually host 2 workshops, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. During the workshops, my co-host Lily and I will lead the workshops at the front of the classroom while the volunteers make sure everyone can follow along with what we're doing.

In between the workshops is the project exhibition. We invite Scratch enthusiasts from all over Taiwan to come and share their unique projects with us. This is a great opportunity to show the kids that Scratch is also capable of handling some pretty complicated and awesome projects. It's always a delight to see kids have fun and get inspired.

Some reflection on my 6 years of hosting Scratch Day events annually.
<h3>Learning to share different sides of the same story</h3>
Organizing these events has taught me, more than anything, to see things from other people's perspective. Our preparation work often involves reaching out the schools for venues, government for funding, and parents for sign ups. I learned that by preparing our material specifically with the other party's interests in mind helps us both get to what we need quicker. Although, I must also emphasize, these different narratives are not contradicting to each other - we are not changing the story to satisfy each party - we are simply sharing different sides of the same truth. The story must be genuine. 
<h3>Children are the most honest audience</h3>
If children are bored, they will say it to your face.<br/>Letting a child down may be the worst feeling an educator will ever have to endure.
I keep this lesson close to my heart to remind myself that every single workshop is an opportunity to leave someone with a curious spark that they will tinker with and potentially even ignite something within them. But in that same vein, the opposite can also happen. I must admit, there have been workshops where I was not giving everything my 100%, that I felt I was designing lesson plans based on what the adults in the room would want to hear me say, designing things thinking they would make for good portfolio pieces to show how I can integrate relevant bleeding edge tech into my classrooms... All of that and I fail to consider the most fundamental question: <em>"Is it fun?"</em> This oversight has resulted in some very memorable and character defining defeats...</div></section>

As we work on Scratch Day year after year, I begin to notice the lessons I learned from Scratch Day improving my other projects and vice versa. I have come to appreciate how easily children can just see through things that adults struggle with. Perhaps it's the world taking away our imagination and fearlessness to dream as we grow up... In the interest of never becoming a "boring adult" in the eyes of children, I have developed an internal benchmark to check my ideas before blindly committing to them. </div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mh08kqy0-xhbiu" data-block-id="block-mh08kqy0-xhbiu" ><div class="quote">If the idea is not something my 9-year-old-self would think is cool, it is probably not actually that cool.</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mh08sv3s-a2rcv" data-block-id="block-mh08sv3s-a2rcv" ><div>The better I become at speaking the language of adults, the more I fear I will lose my sense for the language of children.

<h3>Scratch Day TW 2019</h3>
<strong>May 18, 2019</strong><br/>The first ever Scratch Day Taiwan I organized! This was my first time teaching for a live audience and I was extremely nervous to deliver the workshop back then! I can't recall too many details, all I remember was how surprised I felt when my friends were so quick to say yes when I asked them to come help out as volunteers. This year taught me that people are generally willing to help out out of curiosity. Sometimes all it takes is a warm and enthusiastic invitation!</div></section>

<strong> July 18, 2020</strong><br/>I still think this is one of our most successful Scratch Day events to date! We had a great venue and such a wonderful turn out! This was also the year I published my <a href="https://enochkang.works/secretsofscratch.html" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> so that might be skweing my rose tinted view a certain way. I think the most memorable thing this year was how well the simple yet modular maze game workshop lesson plan I devised worked. I could see that kids of all experience ranges could find something engaging to latch on to and ultimately a simple engaging game was much more effective than some of the more theoretical or experimental workshops I've tried delivering in the following years.

<strong> July 8, 2023</strong> <br/>This was the first year I started experimenting with more experimental workshop content for the event. ChatGPT had gotten really popular around that time and I wanted to try something involving the new tech. The workshop was titled "Little AI Director" and we gave the kids a  fill in the blanks activity which they later put into AI as a prompt for a story. As all first experiments go, this one left me with much improvement to be desired. However, I did see first hand how including marketable ideas dramatically increases interest in our little event. This is something I am still learning to balance: catering to parents in the marketing, catering to children in the actual classroom.</div></section>

<strong> July 5, 2025</strong> <br/>This year we were once again working with Dayuan International Senior High school. We are working on involving the high school volunteers more and more each year. The hope is with more involvement from the volunteers we will be able to improve our capacity and reach larger groups more effectively! This year also got me thinking about the longer term plan for Scratch Day Taiwan as a whole. Since this is something I've committed to organizing each year, I think it would be great if there could be some continuous progression that can accumulate year on year... Maybe it will be in the form of developing a reusable modular lesson plan that is both engaging, practical, and fun!

Our preparation work often involves reaching out the schools for venues, government for funding, and parents for sign ups. I learned that by preparing our material specifically with the other party's interests in mind helps us both get to what we need quicker. Although, I must also emphasize, these different narratives are not contradicting to each other - we are not changing the story to satisfy each party - we are simply sharing different sides of the same truth. The story must be genuine. \n### Children are the most honest audience\nIf children are bored, they will say it to your face.\n\nLetting a child down may be the worst feeling an educator will ever have to endure.\nI keep this lesson close to my heart to remind myself that every single workshop is an opportunity to leave someone with a curious spark that they will tinker with and potentially even ignite something within them. But in that same vein, the opposite can also happen. I must admit, there have been workshops where I was not giving everything my 100%, that I felt I was designing lesson plans based on what the adults in the room would want to hear me say, designing things thinking they would make for good portfolio pieces to show how I can integrate relevant bleeding edge tech into my classrooms... All of that and I fail to consider the most fundamental question: _\"Is it fun?\"_ This oversight has resulted in some very memorable and character defining defeats...",

This was also the year I published my [book](https://enochkang.works/secretsofscratch.html) so that might be skweing my rose tinted view a certain way. I think the most memorable thing this year was how well the simple yet modular maze game workshop lesson plan I devised worked. I could see that kids of all experience ranges could find something engaging to latch on to and ultimately a simple engaging game was much more effective than some of the more theoretical or experimental workshops I've tried delivering in the following years.\n",

ChatGPT had gotten really popular around that time and I wanted to try something involving the new tech. The workshop was titled \"Little AI Director\" and we gave the kids a  fill in the blanks activity which they later put into AI as a prompt for a story. As all first experiments go, this one left me with much improvement to be desired. However, I did see first hand how including marketable ideas dramatically increases interest in our little event. This is something I am still learning to balance: catering to parents in the marketing, catering to children in the actual classroom.",

The hope is with more involvement from the volunteers we will be able to improve our capacity and reach larger groups more effectively! This year also got me thinking about the longer term plan for Scratch Day Taiwan as a whole. Since this is something I've committed to organizing each year, I think it would be great if there could be some continuous progression that can accumulate year on year... Maybe it will be in the form of developing a reusable modular lesson plan that is both engaging, practical, and fun! \n",
