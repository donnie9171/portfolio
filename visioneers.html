  <section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mguumkah-jbyl9" data-block-id="block-mguumkah-jbyl9" ><div>So when the opportunity arose to  create a project to demo the Motion Platform and DOME projection system combo in our lab, I simply HAD to see it come to life as an interactive-playable-4D-maximalist-spaceship-Disney-ride.  
<h3>Hardware</h3>
The hardware of the project revolves around 2 main components:
<ul><li><strong>The Motion Platform</strong> is a Motion Systems PS-3TM-350 motion platform that was originally used as a firetruck training simulator but has since been repurposed to be a pilot seat. It has 3 degrees of freedom and can support a payload of up to 350kg. Having such a powerful motion platform allows us to move the player's body around in physical space to simulate the momentum they would feel as if they were actually in the virtual spaceship.</li><li><strong>The DOME projection system</strong> is a large dome designed to host VR experiences for multiple participants at once. Unlike the head-mounted displays we commonly see for VR, the DOME makes social and group VR experiences possible. This is especially useful for large group demos which is often the case for our lab. There are 4 projectors secured along the rim of the dome, calibrated to stitch together a seamless 360 continuous projection for the player.</li></ul></div></section>

<ul><li>An analogue throttle, hacked together from a broken racing simulator handbrake and a potentiometer.</li><li>A large control panel, complete with push buttons that light up, engine switches, and an emergency stop button that would park the platform in case of any malfunction.</li><li>A flight simulator joystick with roll, pitch, and yaw input, also a trigger for firing on the enemy bugs in the game.</li></ul></div></section>

  <section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgv4mad4-efroj" data-block-id="block-mgv4mad4-efroj" ><div><h3>Software   </h3>
The software was assembled in Unity. I was lucky to find an <a href="https://unity.com/demos/urp-3d-sample" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Unity demo project</a> that already had the stunning visuals and perfect setting as a starting point. Though, the original demo was created as an immersive animation, not as an interactive game, so we had to adjust many parts to make it fit our project. To enable the player to fly around freely, I took the spaceship off the preplanned rails and wired up controls to the inputs that the others made. From there, Bryan and I also implemented:
<ul><li>Health tracking system: Each entity now had a health assigned to it and will explode when health reaches 0.</li><li>Machine guns! I animated the guns on the player's ship model and added muzzle flash and visual flair and all that.</li><li>Collisions: the player needed to FEEL the impact, so we added colliders to EVERYTHING! All the astroids, all the spaceships, all the giant alien worms!</li></ul><h3>Software + Hardware integration</h3>
This wouldn't be a MR game if we didn't do something interesting with our unique setup!
<ul><li>The motion platform responds dynamically to the player's movements in game. Due to physics and other such pesky rules about our reality, we cannot map the in-game movement 1:1 to the motion platform. So we did our best approximating the movement to prioritize making the feedback <em>feel correct</em> as opposed to making the feedback <em>actually correct</em>.</li><li>As the player's ship takes damage, the engines become less and less stable. This is translated to a constant rumbling from the motion platform that increases as the game goes on. This can make for some chaotic and awesome moments of frenzy!</li><li>Little haptic details like the rumbling of the machine guns or the exponentially increasing rumble when the player hits overdrive throttle and begins to pick up speed at an unsustainable pace can make the game feel so much more alive!</li></ul></div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mguwpktm-t7xy0" data-block-id="block-mguwpktm-t7xy0" ><div>Here it is in action!</div></section>

<h3>Brand Identity</h3>
The Visioneers is a brand identity I created with my fellow colleagues at the Human-systems Interaction and Simulation (HIS) Laboratory at the University of Hong Kong. We were inspired by the way research labs like the MIT Media Lab or the UChicago AxLab were able to inspire their students to create by documenting and sharing their findings in an accessible way and we wanted to start doing the same with the research and projects in our lab too! The name "Visioneers" is an obvious homage to the legendary Disney Imagineers, the engineers and artists that quite literally create magic with their imagination! </div></section>

Voltanic develops a XR (Extended Reality) Content Creation software called <a href="https://www.votanic.com/xrcc/" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRCC</a> that we often use as an accessible alternative to Unity or Unreal for beginners to get started more easily when creating their own VR and XR experiences. <br/>In March 2024 I led a team to organize the very first Visioneers VR Game Jam using XRCC!

It has 3 degrees of freedom and can support a payload of up to 350kg. Having such a powerful motion platform allows us to move the player's body around in physical space to simulate the momentum they would feel as if they were actually in the virtual spaceship.\n- **The DOME projection system** is a large dome designed to host VR experiences for multiple participants at once. Unlike the head-mounted displays we commonly see for VR, the DOME makes social and group VR experiences possible. This is especially useful for large group demos which is often the case for our lab. There are 4 projectors secured along the rim of the dome, calibrated to stitch together a seamless 360 continuous projection for the player.",

      "text": "### Software   \nThe software was assembled in Unity. I was lucky to find an [official Unity demo project](https://unity.com/demos/urp-3d-sample) that already had the stunning visuals and perfect setting as a starting point. Though, the original demo was created as an immersive animation, not as an interactive game, so we had to adjust many parts to make it fit our project. To enable the player to fly around freely, I took the spaceship off the preplanned rails and wired up controls to the inputs that the others made. From there, Bryan and I also implemented:\n- Health tracking system: Each entity now had a health assigned to it and will explode when health reaches 0.\n- Machine guns! I animated the guns on the player's ship model and added muzzle flash and visual flair and all that.\n- Collisions: the player needed to FEEL the impact, so we added colliders to EVERYTHING! All the astroids, all the spaceships, all the giant alien worms!\n### Software + Hardware integration\nThis wouldn't be a MR game if we didn't do something interesting with our unique setup!\n- The motion platform responds dynamically to the player's movements in game. Due to physics and other such pesky rules about our reality, we cannot map the in-game movement 1:1 to the motion platform. So we did our best approximating the movement to prioritize making the feedback _feel correct_ as opposed to making the feedback _actually correct_.\n- As the player's ship takes damage, the engines become less and less stable. This is translated to a constant rumbling from the motion platform that increases as the game goes on. This can make for some chaotic and awesome moments of frenzy!\n- Little haptic details like the rumbling of the machine guns or the exponentially increasing rumble when the player hits overdrive throttle and begins to pick up speed at an unsustainable pace can make the game feel so much more alive!
