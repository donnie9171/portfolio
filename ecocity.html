We wanted to make making eco-bricks fun and rewarding with an app. Our journey can be split into three steps. First, we <strong>developed an app.</strong> Next, we <strong>established our presence</strong> in the community by collaborating with other student-led events. Finally, we <strong>left a mark</strong> and gave back to the community to pass on our ideas.</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mh17fhw4-rjqzr" data-block-id="block-mh17fhw4-rjqzr" ><div><h2>Developing an app</h2>
The app rewards players points for submitting eco-bricks. Players can build their own virtual eco-cities from the points, and competition via the leaderboards encourages students to make more eco-bricks. We also worked with the students running SusCo (Sustainability Council) to monitor the quality.</div></section>
