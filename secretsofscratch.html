The project started as a school project. We were given a year to create whatever "Passion Project" we wanted to. Creative freedom and schoolwork don't usually fit in the same sentence so I knew I had to make the most out of this opportunity! I started developing the book in 2019, and the COVID pandemic was just around the corner. With everyone stuck in online classes, I had a great window to focus all my time into completing this book! Looking back, the 2020 lockdown was probably what made this project happen so quickly and in the way that it did.  </div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgurwxep-8cmhh" data-block-id="block-mgurwxep-8cmhh" ><div>This is a really old project so I don't have too many process photos from that time! I do, however, have a video I created when the book first got published so feel free to check it out if you'd like more information!</div></section>

The animation is of a little stick figure running and leveling up with progressively cooler gear towards the end of the book. The color of the gear and progression of our stick figure hero is matching with each section of the book. As the tutorials get more advanced your little stick figure companion also levels up with you.</div></section>

In addition to being available online and in bookstores, I recently found out that my book is actually available for kids to read for free via public libraries in Taiwan!
