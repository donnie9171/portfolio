The project started as a school project. We were given a year to create whatever "Passion Project" we wanted to. Creative freedom and schoolwork don't usually fit in the same sentence so I knew I had to make the most out of this opportunity! I started developing the book in 2019, and the COVID pandemic was just around the corner. With everyone stuck in online classes, I had a great window to focus all my time into completing this book! Looking back, the 2020 lockdown was probably what made this project happen so quickly and in the way that it did.  </div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgurwxep-8cmhh" data-block-id="block-mgurwxep-8cmhh" ><div>This is a really old project so I don't have too many process photos from that time! I do, however, have a video I created when the book first got published so feel free to check it out if you'd like more information!</div></section>

This was one of my first really large scale projects! Many of the lessons learned here still carry over to the things I am working on today!
<h3>Planning in modules</h3>
I learned to plan out large projects into smaller modules. Then, I could determine the priority/dependency of each module and decide which part I had to tackle first. Breaking it down into modules also meant that I could adjust the scope easily depending on the time constraint. Since I only had a year to work on the book, I actually shaved 3-4 chapters off the roadmap as there simply wasn't enough time to make everything. However, it is exactly because of this scope adjustment that I was able to even complete the book at all, so actually done is better than hypothetically perfect. Besides,</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgvws37c-ic6op" data-block-id="block-mgvws37c-ic6op" ><div class="quote">“A work of art is never finished. It is merely abandoned.” - (I could not find a source that everyone agrees on)</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgvwseab-7o7pk" data-block-id="block-mgvwseab-7o7pk" ><div><h3>The best time to start is when you feel like you're almost ready</h3>
You'd be surprised how much you can figure out on the spot.<br/>When I started the project, I had no experience writing, no experience planning layouts for books, no experience making digital art, and absolutely no idea how to  publish. All I had was a mock up of a cover I made in Canva and a dream... This project taught me to embrace the discomfort of progressively biting off slightly more than I can chew as a signal for potential growth.</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgvxll79-llmfp" data-block-id="block-mgvxll79-llmfp" ><div class="quote">"If you don't fail at least 90 percent of the time, you're not aiming high enough." - Alan Kay</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgvxmu7q-nh0rz" data-block-id="block-mgvxmu7q-nh0rz" ><div><h3>Falling in love with Hard Fun</h3>
Big things are a lot of trouble to make but it's <em>always</em> worth it in the end. <br/>Borrowing the term "<a href="https://dailypapert.com/hard-fun/" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hard Fun</a>" from Seymour Papert, I've found it productive to view complicated challenges in projects as opportunities to be creative and think outside of the box. A change in perspective can reframe a hard obstacle into a fun challenge! 
<h3>I really like making physical media</h3>
Maybe its from my childhood bias of practically growing up in a bookstore but I found that I really love making tangible things that can be shared in the real world. Since the creation of this book, I have also dabbled in zine making, comics, and I'm even thinking of making a novel one day!</div></section>

Then, I could determine the priority/dependency of each module and decide which part I had to tackle first. Breaking it down into modules also meant that I could adjust the scope easily depending on the time constraint. Since I only had a year to work on the book, I actually shaved 3-4 chapters off the roadmap as there simply wasn't enough time to make everything. However, it is exactly because of this scope adjustment that I was able to even complete the book at all, so actually done is better than hypothetically perfect. Besides,",
