  <section class="project-block center-text" ><div><h2>Why</h2>
<strong>Problems:</strong>
<ul><li>Many STEAM toys are considered expensive in Asia, making them inaccessible for beginners as public schools are unlikely to have funding to afford getting each kid their own kit. </li><li>We generate around 40 million tons of e-waste every year. A large percentage of which consists of obsolete keyboards.</li></ul>
<strong>Solution(?):</strong> 
<ul><li>Matchbox is an affordable DIY controller kit designed for beginners with parts sourced from obsolete keyboards. </li><li>By assembling a controller from inexpensive upcycled parts, everyone gets to have a fun and accessible introduction to hardware engineering!</li></ul></div></section>

<h3>Affordable Hardware</h3>
The Matchbox kit is made from upcycled components and common electrical components like breadboards and push buttons. This helps keep the cost down while still providing a fun and engaging learning opportunity!</div></section>

      </div>
    </section>
  <section class="project-block center-text" ><div><h3>Accessible Workshops</h3>
The second crucial component of the Matchbox project is how the <strong>workshops</strong> are designed. We spent months iterating on exactly how the workshop is delivered so that we can make sure <strong><em>learners of any skill level will be able to complete their very own working Matchbox by the end of a 2hr workshop.</em></strong> </div></section>

      </div>
    </section>
  <section class="project-block center-text" ><div>This promise is important to us because I believe beginner level STEAM education material can be a double edge sword: when done well, the experience could inspire the learner to begin pursuing their curiosity in STEAM concepts; but when done poorly, a bad first experience with STEAM can convince a beginner that they are not an "engineering person" and miss out on many wonderful creative opportunities for the rest of their lives.</div></section>

    </section>
  <section class="project-block center-text" ><div><h3>Adaptive Software</h3>
Our custom workshop software was created to solve two problems:
<ul><li>Each learner has a different amount of prior experience and wants to move at a <em>different pace</em>. Yet the workshop staff can only advance at <em>one pace</em> (often the slowest one to accommodate newer people). </li><li>Assembly is complicated and many steps are difficult to backtrack after some point. If we only help the learners test their controllers at the end of the workshops there will be a high likelihood they made a mistake earlier, didn't realize it, and now the error has snowballed into something unsolvable within 2hrs (fails the 2hr workshop completion promise).</li></ul></div></section>

      </div>
    </section>
  <section class="project-block center-text" ><div>We iterated on many versions of the workshop material before settling on building our own digital instruction manual tool. Our tool features step by step pictures of the assembly, alongside an always-available keyboard tester tool at the bottom of the screen. This tool is important because we want the kids to develop the habit of testing as they go, and we can install checkpoints in each major step of the assembly so that we can troubleshoot early and not have to backtrack too much under a time constraint. </div></section><section class="project-block center-text" ><div>The digital instructions also provided the learner with all the material to follow at their own pace. We found this was especially effective in solving the pacing issue when the range of experience is large in a group. The experienced learners can peek ahead and won't become bored and disengaged while waiting, and the less experienced can take their time knowing that they will still have access to everything (the manual is just a <a href="https://matchbox.build/" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>) even if they cannot finish all the steps during the workshop time.</div></section><section class="project-block"><div class="separator line"></div></section><section class="project-block center-text" ><div><h2>Development</h2>

<h3>Inspiration (v0) | Aug 2019</h3>
The first Matchboxes were created in 2019. Inspired by the MakeyMakey, I wanted to make Scratch-compatible controllers to play my Scratch games.
The prototype simply has 10 buttons per controller connected to a MakeyMakey sitting inside a plastic box.</div></section>

The first prototypes using actual keyboard parts was the v0.1. We started by simply soldering each pin on the keyboard PCB directly to the blank PCB board to expose the pins to the top. Then we could wire buttons
to simulate keyboard button 
presses.</div></section>

This allowed us to hide all the messy wires and fragile connections in a  box and have proper button caps! We also experimented with different button switches. The black controller has clicky buttons while the 
white one has soft
membrane buttons.
Models were made in
Fusion360 and printed
at our university’s makerspace (Innowing @ HKU)</div></section>

There were 2 main problems with v0.1:
<ul><li>Too many wires</li><li>Hand-soldering takes too long!</li></ul>So we focused on solving those problems in v0.2. Bryan got to work putting together a custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board) that could replace our old hand-wired version. </div></section>

of velcro hooks! Imagine soldering a whole row of 
30 pins by hand!</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" ><div>Eventually, we learned about elastomeric connectors and realized they would be perfect for the job.

After more workshops and iteration, we are currently at prototype v0.4! This iteration focuses on simplifying the workshop assembly experience while retaining the customizability for advanced users to hack and make whatever they want (lowering the floors while keeping the ceilings high, if you will). Here are the key improvements:
<ul><li>Alignment and orientation: The new "TOP SIDE" label and triangle cut out of the corner ensure it's (nearly) impossible to assemble the PCB upside down or inside out (people somehow found ways to do both - at the same time! - with our previous version).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pre-mapped wiring options: The new presets of keys at the top of the PCB help people map and remap their Matchboxes easily without the complicated lookup table (v0.3). This saves valuable time in the workshops and makes more time for playing games!</li></ul></div></section><section class="project-block"><div class="separator line"></div></section><section class="project-block center-text"  data-card-event="Matchbox isam2024"><div><h2>Conferences and Awards</h2>

  <section class="project-block center-text" ><div>Continuing that chain of thought, a staff from our makerspace saw the Matchbox boxes and remarked that it would be really cool if there was actually some match-shaped thing in the kit.
