<strong>Problems:</strong>
<ul><li>Many STEAM toys are considered expensive in Asia, making them inaccessible for beginners as public schools are unlikely to have funding to afford getting each kid their own kit. </li><li>We generate around 40 million tons of e-waste every year. A large percentage of which consists of obsolete keyboards.</li></ul>
<strong>Solution(?):</strong> 
<ul><li>Matchbox is an affordable DIY controller kit designed for beginners with parts sourced from obsolete keyboards. </li><li>By assembling a controller from inexpensive upcycled parts, everyone gets to have a fun and accessible introduction to hardware engineering!</li></ul></div></section>

The second crucial component of the Matchbox project is how the <strong>workshops</strong> are designed. We spent months iterating on exactly how the workshop is delivered so that we can make sure <strong><em>learners of any skill level will be able to complete their very own working Matchbox by the end of a 2hr workshop.</em></strong> </div></section>

  <section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgpznq8h-q04dv" data-block-id="block-mgpznq8h-q04dv" ><div><h3>Adaptive Software</h3>
Our custom workshop software was created to solve two problems:
<ul><li>Each learner has a different amount of prior experience and wants to move at a <em>different pace</em>. Yet the workshop staff can only advance at <em>one pace</em> (often the slowest one to accommodate newer people). </li><li>Assembly is complicated and many steps are difficult to backtrack after some point. If we only help the learners test their controllers at the end of the workshops there will be a high likelihood they made a mistake earlier, didn't realize it, and now the error has snowballed into something unsolvable within 2hrs (fails the 2hr workshop completion promise).</li></ul></div></section>

Our tool features step by step pictures of the assembly, alongside an always-available keyboard tester tool at the bottom of the screen. This tool is important because we want the kids to develop the habit of testing as they go, and we can install checkpoints in each major step of the assembly so that we can troubleshoot early and not have to backtrack too much under a time constraint. </div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgpznq8h-5k8mk" data-block-id="block-mgpznq8h-5k8mk" ><div>The digital instructions also provided the learner with all the material to follow at their own pace. We found this was especially effective in solving the pacing issue when the range of experience is large in a group. The experienced learners can peek ahead and won't become bored and disengaged while waiting, and the less experienced can take their time knowing that they will still have access to everything (the manual is just a <a href="https://matchbox.build/" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>) even if they cannot finish all the steps during the workshop time.</div></section><section class="project-block" id="preview-block-block-mgpznq8h-9v9sc" data-block-id="block-mgpznq8h-9v9sc"><div class="separator line"></div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgpznq8h-0f4a6" data-block-id="block-mgpznq8h-0f4a6" ><div><h2>How</h2>

<h3>Inspiration (v0) | Aug 2019</h3>
The first Matchboxes were created in 2019. Inspired by the <a href="https://makeymakey.com/" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Makey Makey</a>, I wanted to make Scratch-compatible controllers to play my Scratch games.
The prototype simply has 10 buttons per controller connected to a MakeyMakey sitting inside a plastic box.</div></section>

After more workshops and iteration, we are currently at prototype v0.4! This iteration focuses on simplifying the workshop assembly experience while retaining the customizability for advanced users to hack and make whatever they want (lowering the floors while keeping the ceilings high, if you will). Here are the key improvements:
<ul><li>Alignment and orientation: The new "TOP SIDE" label and triangle cut out of the corner ensure it's (nearly) impossible to assemble the PCB upside down or inside out (people somehow found ways to do both - at the same time! - with our previous version). </li><li>Pre-mapped wiring options: The new presets of keys at the top of the PCB help people map and remap their Matchboxes easily without the complicated lookup table (v0.3). This saves valuable time in the workshops and makes more time for playing games!</li></ul></div></section><section class="project-block" id="preview-block-block-mgpznq8h-zvoal" data-block-id="block-mgpznq8h-zvoal"><div class="separator line"></div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgpznq8h-58i5o" data-block-id="block-mgpznq8h-58i5o"  data-card-event="Matchbox isam2024"><div><h2>Conferences and Awards</h2>

How poetic! An artwork of my favorite medium (screenprinting) finding me while we are on our great Matchbox adventure to the UK (this was our first conference) and it's a peice about optimism and features a literal match!

To close off the project (since Hei and I are graduating university in 2026, and Bryan has already graduated in 2025). We want to open source the project so that the Matchbox idea can live on, even when the 3 of us are not available to work directly on it anymore. Another reason we've been inspired to open source the project from the start has been because of how much we ourselves have learned from the open source community over the years. We want to share our mistakes and progress openly so that others don't have to spend time making the same mistakes and can just build off of what we have created. Additionally, we believe the Matchbox has a really high customization potential for makers everywhere to take it on new adventures, one upcycled keyboard at a time!
Here are just some of our own explorations made during a Matchbox Game Jam!</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mgpznq8h-x4wwk" data-block-id="block-mgpznq8h-x4wwk" ><div><strong><em>Matchbox Excavator</em></strong> (by Enoch)</div></section>

This iteration focuses on simplifying the workshop assembly experience while retaining the customizability for advanced users to hack and make whatever they want (lowering the floors while keeping the ceilings high, if you will). Here are the key improvements:\n- Alignment and orientation: The new \"TOP SIDE\" label and triangle cut out of the corner ensure it's (nearly) impossible to assemble the PCB upside down or inside out (people somehow found ways to do both - at the same time! - with our previous version). \n- Pre-mapped wiring options: The new presets of keys at the top of the PCB help people map and remap their Matchboxes easily without the complicated lookup table (v0.3). This saves valuable time in the workshops and makes more time for playing games! ",
