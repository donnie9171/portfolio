          <h2>About the job</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Scratch Foundation</strong> is a nonprofit organization
            dedicated to supporting creative learning through coding. Scratch,
            the flagship product, is the world’s largest online coding community
            for children and teens. It empowers young people to create
            interactive games, stories, and animations while fostering skills
            such as creative thinking, systematic reasoning, and collaboration.
            <br /><br />

            <strong>Scratch Lab</strong> is the experimental research and
            development team within the Scratch Foundation. Its primary mission
            is to explore new ideas, prototype innovative features, and conduct
            playtests to validate future directions for the Scratch platform.
            The team focuses on speculative projects that push the boundaries of
            creative learning experiences, including initiatives like Creative
            AI, hardware integrations, and advanced block-based programming
            enhancements.

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <p>
          Over the three-month internship, I contributed to several projects:
        </p>
        <h3>Creative Learning Assistant (CLA) Frontend</h3>
      </section>
      <section class="project-block large-image">
        <div class="project-images no-shadow no-ratio" style="--img-count: 1">

        <p>
          The CLA is a prototype chatbot designed to assist Scratch users in
          exploring creative possibilities. The panel
          <strong>[fig. 2]</strong> sits to the right of the Scratch editor
          (similar to Copilot in VS Code) and assists the user with various
          Scratch related AI functionalities. My contributions included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Implemented chat interface features that support multiple content
            types:
            <ul>
              <li>Text responses <strong>[fig. 4]</strong></li>
              <li>Code stack previews <strong>[fig. 3]</strong></li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scratch Lab Deep Linking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Built, tested, and deployed to production deep link functionality
            for Scratch Lab projects and editors.

        </ul>
        <h3>Transition to Blockly for Rendering</h3>
        <p>
          In August, I assisted in transitioning block rendering from Scratch
          Blocks to Blockly within the CLA and Blockhelp prototypes. This
          included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Investigating rendering discrepancies.</li>
          <li>
            Refactoring frontend components for compatibility with Blockly’s
            rendering system.

        <p>
          This internship and trip to visit the Lifeling Kindergarten lab at MIT
          Media Lab has truly been an eye-opening experience. I have never been
          in an environment where there is so much shared context on the topic
          of Scratch and STEAM education! It felt like everyone I met was so
          passionate about education and cared so deeply about the learning
          experiences of all learners.
          <br /><br />
          The internship also challenged me to grow professionally as a
          programmer. I have never had the opporunity to work in a team managing
          a system of such scale before. From dreading the never-ending npm
          errors to eventually learning to navigate the complicated
          repositories, I've grown to appreciate good systems and architecture
          even more.
          <br /><br />
          Working alongside professional software engineers and designers also
          taught me many valuable lessons on product development. From all the
          playtests to long evaluation meetings, everything is handled with so
          much care that it's incredibly inspiring to see how high the bar is
          set in terms of what is really good enough for a child. This motivates
          me to carry out my own development projects with this same standard
          and eye for quiality.

        <h2>Something Fun</h2>
        <p>
          This entire adventure wouldn't have been possible if my supervisor and
          mentor Eric Rosenbaum hadn't given me the opportunity to reach out and
          share my work with him in the summer of 2024. Throughout the entire
          journey, despite having to juggle so many responsibilities, Eric still
          somehow managed to make time to set up these opportunities and even to
          meet with me in person to work in Boston. I am immensely grateful and
          knew I had to do something special for him before our last in-person
          day together at the Media Lab.
          <br /><br />
          I wanted to make a thank-you card for Eric. But it couldn't just be
          any card, it had to feel like I made it... it had to be a
          <strong>TRADING CARD!</strong>

            Now that I had the artwork settled, I needed to find some relevant text to put on the card. As I was making this card, I was thinking back on all the ways Eric's work has inspired me in the past and I remembered this quote from an article he'd written a few years back: 
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
            “Even if it’s been done before, you can find your own way. Use your unique weirdness to bring magic to the world.” - Eric Rosenbaum, 2020. <a href="https://medium.com/@eric.rosenbaum/glowdoodle-a-love-letter-to-light-painting-33bc94b17d41" style="color: inherit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glowdoodle: A Love Letter to Light Painting </a>
        </div>
        <p>
            This message is very special to me because one our my projects (Matchbox) is directly inspired by the Eric's work on the MakeyMakey. At the start of the project, I would sometimes think to myself: Does Matchbox really contribute something new to the conversation, or am I just spending all this time making something that someone else has already solved? But after having met Eric and been encouraged by his works, I now proudly forge forward into the unknown, following the footsteps left by the giants before us.
        </p>
            <div class="cardbox onecard" data-card-event="Eric Rosenbaum">
          <div class="trading-card-modal-card" style="max-width: 400px;">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            So that's the complete card! I had some help printing them out and cut and glued everything just in time! I had so much fun learning from Eric and the rest of the team, really hope there will be more opprotunities to work together in the future!
