This entire adventure wouldn't have been possible if my supervisor and mentor Eric Rosenbaum hadn't given me the opportunity to reach out and share my work with him in the summer of 2024. Throughout the entire journey, despite having to juggle so many responsibilities, Eric still somehow managed to make time to set up these opportunities and even to meet with me in person to work in Boston. I am immensely grateful and knew I had to do something special for him before our last in-person day together at the Media Lab.</div></section><section class="project-block center-text" id="preview-block-block-mh4iz7br-3yexj" data-block-id="block-mh4iz7br-3yexj" ><div>I wanted to make a thank-you card for Eric.
